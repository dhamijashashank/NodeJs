Doubts :
1. What is difference between single quates(' ') , double quates(" ") and tilted quotes (``)
Ans :	If we write any thing in single or double quotes then it will treat as string and print on console as it is but if we 
	we using tilted quotes(` `) we can access variable in it like this `Hello ${user.username}!` .suppose usename is 	krishna then output is "Hello krishna !" , we are able to append variable without using + operator.
