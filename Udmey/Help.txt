	Example 1: project name :n-2-6-hello-world 
		Explination : Having print statment ( using console)
	
Section 3 :Node Js Fundamental ( Note App)
	Example 2: Project Name : n-3-2-module-basics
		Explination : Show basic use of require
			* Load in Modules that come bundle with node JS Like HTTP(which let us make web server) and FS(for 			     access the file from our machine ) Module 
			* To Load 3rd Party Library like express
			* To Load other files written by us like if we write code in multiple file and we want to import code 				from supporting file to main file then we use this 
	
	Example 3: Project Name : n-3-3-require-own-files : Video 10
		Explination : Show how to use require for importing own file.
			* If we want to export any method of file then it should be like below

	Example 5: Project Name : n-3-5-global-module : video 12
		Explination : 
			* nodemon : If we want to restrat server once you make any change in code 
			Example : nodemon app.js ( insted of using node app.js we have to use nodemon).

1. What is difference between single quates(' ') , double quates(" ") and tilted quotes (``)
Ans :	If we write any thing in single or double quotes then it will treat as string and print on console as it is but if we 
	we using tilted quotes(` `) we can access variable in it like this `Hello ${user.username}!` .suppose usename is 	krishna then output is "Hello krishna !" , we are able to append variable without using + operator.
2. Difference between const , var and let in node js ?
3. While importing some lib we name variable like _ what does it means?
